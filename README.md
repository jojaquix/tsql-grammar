ms-sql-gold-grammar
===================

A T-SQL grammar for Gold Parser.

It is an extention of the original T-SQL grammar for Gold Parser by Ars√®ne von Wyss. 
C.f. http://code.google.com/p/bsn-modulestore/source/browse/bsn.ModuleStore.Parser/Sql/ModuleStoreSQL.grm

This grammar parses a subset of SQL commands. It parses many of my productive SQL scripts, views and procedures as long as they do not contain "weird" characters in strings.

Check the .grm file for comments and the license which applies.
